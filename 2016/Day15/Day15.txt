Use Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve:
x = 11 mod 13
x = 7 mod 19
x = 1 mod 3
x = 2 mod 7
x = 2 mod 5
x = 6 mod 17

(With addition for part 2:)
x = 4 mod 11

Formulas comes from taking a disc with #discNumber (initialPosition,
maxPosition) and converting by:

x = (-(initialPosition + discNumber) % maxPosition) (mod maxPosition)

Intuition: when ball reaches the disc, it has moved discNumbers steps,
and it wraps around when reaching maxPosition, and the minus signs
comes from that we want position + time == (mod maxPosition) which gives that
time == -position (mod maxPosition).
